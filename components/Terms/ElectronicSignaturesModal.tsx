        <p className="es-modal-content-title bold">Definitions:</p>
        <p className="es-modal-text">
          “We,” “us,” “our” and “Carvana” means Carvana LLC, its successors, assigns, parents,
          subsidiaries, affiliates, service providers and other contractual partners.
        </p>
        <p className="es-modal-text">“You” and “your” means the person giving this consent.</p>
        <p className="es-modal-text">
          “Records” means all documents related to the sale and financing of a used motor vehicle
          from Carvana, such as your credit application, your retail installment contract, consumer
          disclosures, billing statements, online bill payments and payment authorizations,
          transaction histories, privacy policies, and all other communication or information
          related to the product or service you obtain from us, including any records we are
          required by law to provide to you in writing.
        </p>

        <p className="es-modal-content-title bold">Scope of consent:</p>
        <p className="es-modal-text">
          By giving your consent, you agree to conduct transactions with Carvana electronically,
          including using electronic signatures. You agree that such electronic signatures will
          consist of clicking on buttons and/or checking boxes where indicated. You also consent to
          the use of electronic Records, including Records sent to you electronically, instead of
          receiving them on paper or by regular mail. We may provide Records to you electronically
          by posting them online or by email, which may include the Records as attachments or as
          embedded links. Your consent will be effective unless you withdraw it in the manner
          provided below. Your consent will apply to any transaction or agreement that you may enter
          into with us in the future that modifies or extends your original transaction.
        </p>

        <p className="es-modal-content-title bold">How to update your contact information:</p>
        <p className="es-modal-text">
          You agree to provide us with your accurate email address and personal contact information
          and to promptly notify us of any changes. If you have a working email address, your
          personal contact information must include that email address. You can update your
          information (including your email address) on our website or by contacting us at{" "}
          {advocatePhoneNumber}. If email is undeliverable to your email address for three
          consecutive months, your consent will be considered withdrawn and we will send you future
          Records in writing.
        </p>

        <p className="es-modal-content-title bold">Obtaining paper copies:</p>
        <p className="es-modal-text">
          You may obtain a paper copy of a Record by printing it from your electronic device or by
          contacting us at {advocatePhoneNumber}. We may charge you a reasonable service charge for
          providing you with a paper copy of any Record. The request for a paper copy of a Record
          will not by itself constitute a withdrawal of your consent to receive Records
          electronically. We reserve the right, but are not required, to send a paper copy of any
          Record you authorize us to provide electronically.
        </p>

        <p className="es-modal-content-title bold">Withdrawing consent:</p>
        <p className="es-modal-text">
          If you do not consent to the use of electronic signatures and Records, you will not be
          able to complete your purchase of a motor vehicle. In addition, if you give your consent,
          but withdraw it before completing your purchase, you will not be able to complete your
          purchase. After you have completed your purchase, you may at any time withdraw your
          consent to receive Records electronically, and instead elect at any time to use the U.S.
          Postal Service to obtain Records, by updating your profile information through your online
          account or by contacting us at {advocatePhoneNumber}.
        </p>
        <p className="es-modal-text">
          We will not impose any fee if you withdraw your consent to receive Records electronically
          but our communications with you may be slower. If you withdraw your consent to receive
          Records electronically, such withdrawal will not apply to Records that were furnished to
          you electronically before the date on which the withdrawal of your consent takes effect.
